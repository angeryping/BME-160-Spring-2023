    "## Design specification \n",
    "\n",
    "### \\_\\_init\\_\\_\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to design this.  Your \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method could save an attribute which is just the input string. A more effective solution would compute and save the aaComposition dictionary. All of the protein parameter methods can operate very efficiently using a dictionary. Use of an aaComposition here will save you quite a bit of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### aaCount()\n",
    "\n",
    "This method will return a single integer count of valid amino acid characters found. Do not assume that this is the length of the input string, since you might have spaces or invalid characters that are required to be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### aaComposition() - 4 points\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is to return a dictionary keyed by single letter Amino acid code, and having associated values that are the counts of those amino acids in the sequence. Make sure to include all 20 amino acids.  Proper amino acids that are not represented in the sequence should have a value of zero. Note: if you have already calculated a composition dictionary in __init__, then just return that dictionary here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### molecularWeight() - 8 points\n",
    "\n",
    "This method calculates the molecular weight (MW) of the protein sequence. If we have the composition of our protein, this is done by summing the weights of the individual Amino acids and excluding the waters that are released with peptide bond formation. \n",
    "$$MW_{H_{2}O}+\\sum^{aa}N_{aa}(MW_{aa}-MW_{H_{2}O})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\_charge\\_(pH) -- 10 points\n",
    "\n",
    "This method calculates the net charge on the protein at a specific pH (specified as a parameter of this method). The method is used by the pI method. I have marked it with the single _ notation to advise future users of the class that this is not part of the defined interface and it just might change.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have the composition of our protein, we can then calculate the net charge at a particular pH, using the pKa of each charged Amino acid and the Nterminus and Cterminus.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ netCharge = \\left[\\sum^{aa=(Arg,Lys,His,Nterm}N_{aa}\\frac{10^{pKa(aa)}}{10^{pKa(aa)}+10^{pH}}\\right] - \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I have provided pKa tables for each AA, and the pKa for the N-terminus and C-terminus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### pI() - 10 points\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical isolelectric point can be estimated by finding the  particular pH that yields a neutral net Charge (close to 0). There are a few ways of doing this, but the simplest might be to iterate over all pH values to find the one that is closest to 0. Doing this by hand is painful, but its not that bad to do computationally.  Remember that we want to find the  best pH, accurate to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### extra credit (3 points) for pI() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of doing the pI calculation would use a binary search over the pH range. This works because we expect a single zero crossing to exist in the range, and the function will be well behaved across the range of charge() as a function of pH (0-14 range). You then make the algorithm operate to any specified precision using an optional parameter (set the default parameter: precision = 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### molarExtinction() - 8 points\n",
    "\n",
    "The extinction coefficient indicates how much light a protein absorbs at a certain wavelength. It is useful to have an estimation of this coefficient for measuring a protein with a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 280nm. It has been shown by Gill and von Hippel that it is possible to estimate the molar extinction coefficient of a protein from knowledge of its amino acid composition alone. From the molar extinction coefficient of tyrosine, tryptophan and cystine at a given wavelength, the extinction coefficient of the native protein in water can be computed using the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = N_Y E_Y + N_W E_W + N_C E_C$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $N_Y$ is the number of tyrosines, $N_W$ is the number of tryptophans, $N_C$ is the number of cysteines,\n",
    "- $E_Y$ , $E_W$, $E_C$ are the extinction coefficients for tyrosine, tryptophan, and cysteine respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have supplied the molar extinction coefficients at 280nm for each of these residues in a dictionary(aa2abs280) in the program template.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we will assume for this exercise that all Cysteine residues are represented as Cystine. Under reducing conditions, Cystine does not form however and Cysteine residues do not contribute to absorbance at 280nm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### massExtinction()\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the Mass extinction coefficient from the Molar Extinction coefficient by dividing by the molecularWeight of the corresponding protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### extra credit for molarExtinction() and massExtinction() - 3 points\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, we are assuming that all Cysteine residues are present as Cystine.  Provide an optional parameter to both molarExtinction() and massExtinction() to calculate these values assuming reducing conditions. Use an optional parameter with a default of True (Cystine=True) to allow evaluation of both molar and mass extinction under both oxidizing (default) and reducing conditions."

    "**Kimberly's Inspection**: We implemented the dictionary function differently. I created a totally different dictionary with its own keys while you made use of the keys from the aa2mw dictionary. It is also very interesting how you created a new protein string if there were invalid characters which is something that I didn't think to do in my own code. For your _charge_ method, you managed to do a one-liner while also using the sum() and pow() methods which is pretty unique. Lastly, for the molar extinction method, I instead used a for loop but it's clever and easier to read your implementation of this function. One thing I would recommend is to move the given values to its respective areas just so the code is a bit more readible. Detailed docstrings and comments! Great work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aster's Inspection**: As Kimberely mentioned, we also implemented the dictionary function differently. Mine was done in a similar way to Kimberely's. I think it is interesting that you turned the valid amino acids into a list. It was smart of you to use the preexisting keys of the previous dictionary instead of creating a completely new one. It is really insteresting how you did your _charge_ method. It is much less typing, which is more efficient. Our PI and molar extinction methods are both similar. In your range, why did you do 1400+1 instead of 1401? It is easier for me to understand that with my previous understanding of range (not in coding). Nice detailed docstrings! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Faiz's Inspection:** Looks like the molecular weight and PI still need to be implented. I also noticed you used one-liners for the molecular weight and charge method. Even though it won't affect your code I'd recommend seperating into different lines for the sake of readability. Other than that additional comments would be beneficial before you submit. "
